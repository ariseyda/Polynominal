# Polynominal
Define a structure called polynomial with following properties:  
- term_count stores number of terms the polynomial has. A polynomial can store a maximum of 10 terms.  
- coefficients is an array of real values and stores each term’s coefficient value.  
- exponents is an array of integer values and stores each term’s exponent value.  
- coefficients and exponents are parallel arrays, i.e. coefficients[i] ∙ xexponents[i].  
Write a function that scans a polynomial from user. Write a function that print a polynomial on console. 
Test your code in a program. Scan a polynomial from user and display it on console.
